# Element Miniscope Calcium Imaging

This Element features a DataJoint schema for functional calcium imaging data acquired with the UCLA Miniscope and `Miniscope DAQ V4` acquisition system, and analyzed with `CaImAn`. Each Element is a modular pipeline for data storage and processing with corresponding database tables that can be combined with other Elements to assemble a fully functional pipeline.

Visit the [Concepts page](./concepts.md) for more information about the tables in the `miniscope` schema. To get started with building your data pipeline visit the [Tutorials page](./tutorials.md).
