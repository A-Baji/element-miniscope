- [x] Ingestion of data processed with CaImAn
- [x] Image processing with CaImAn
  - [x] Motion correction
  - [x] Cell segmentation 
  - [x] Fluorescence trace extraction
  - [x] Spike inference
  - [x] Cell classification
- [x] Store curations of the processed results
- [x] Example data
- [x] Pytests for quality assurance
- [x] Quality metrics
- [ ] Data export to NWB

Further development of this Element is community driven. Upon user requests and based on
guidance from the Scientific Steering Group we will continue adding features to this 
Element.
